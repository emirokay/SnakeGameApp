The Snake Game App is a SwiftUI implementation of the classic Snake game, featuring a clean interface that supports both light and dark modes. Built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, it allows players to customize gameplay with adjustable cell sizes (Small, Medium, Large) and timer intervals (Slow, Medium, Fast). The app dynamically updates the UI based on user settings, with alerts for game over and win conditions, ensuring an engaging experience. Utilizing SwiftUI and Combine, it offers a smooth gameplay experience while maintaining code organization and maintainability.
